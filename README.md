This bot fetches the overall consensus of the 5min and 1min BNB/USDT charts based on a number of TA signals provided by Trading View. It determines if the consensus is a BUY or SELL prior to each prediction round and places the bet on PancakeSwap or CandleGenie accordingly.

## üßë‚Äçüé® Strategies
- Default Strategy: Bets against what the majority of money is betting on. It generally aims for the higher payout bet. Better for sideways trends where its harder for the majority of people to bet correctly & confidently.

- `--with` Strategy: Bets with what the majority of money is betting on. It generally aims to follow the lower payout bet. Better for swinging trends where its easier for the majority of people to bet correctly & confidently.

### Using CandleGenie? 
If you want to play with Candle Genie instead of Pancake, start the bot with `npm run cg` or `yarn cg`

- To use the alternate `with` strategy, start the bot using `npm run start -- --with` or `yarn start -- --with`.
- For CandleGenie, use `npm run cg -- --with` or `yarn cg -- --with`

Running this bot for a day had made me $55 with minimum bets. Please note I was actively monitoring the market as the bot was running.

#### üì¢ Advice:
- Run the bot with your wallet at a ratio of 10x the amount you choose to bet.
- Adjust the bot accordingly to bet with or against the majority.
- When the chart swings, use the "--with" strategy.
- When the chart trends sideways, use the default, against strategy. 
- Always monitor & adjust the bot accordingly but allow room for error.
- Consistent gains will be made by running smaller betting amounts over longer periods of time. 
- Always account & allow room for error. Losing 3 sucks, but stopping it only prevents it from potentially winning the next 4 & bringing you to a profit. 
- Majority of the runs with over 2k plays I have a standard 54-66% win rate depending on how well I monitor it & based on market conditions.
